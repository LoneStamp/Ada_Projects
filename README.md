# Ada Learning Projects

A hands-on project roadmap for learning the **Ada programming language**.

This repository documents my journey in learning Ada through structured exercises, mini-projects, and practical implementations.

---

## About Ada

**Ada** is a high-level, structured, and statically typed programming language designed for reliability, safety, and maintainability. It is widely used in:

- Aerospace and aviation systems  
- Defense and military applications  
- Embedded and real-time systems  
- Safety-critical software  

Ada emphasizes correctness, readability, and long-term software sustainability.

---

## Why Learn Ada?

Ada offers powerful features and strong guarantees:

- Strong static typing  
- Built-in concurrency support (tasking)  
- Exception handling  
- Modular programming with packages  
- High reliability for safety-critical systems  
- Support for formal verification (via SPARK)

---

## Requirements

To run and build the projects in this repository, you will need:

- [GNAT Studio](https://www.adacore.com/gnatpro/toolsuite/gnatstudio) – Ada IDE
- [SPARK](https://www.adacore.com/sparkpro) – For formal verification (optional but recommended)
- Ada compiler (GNAT Community Edition or equivalent)

Also:

- Browse the `docs/` folder  
- Check `RESOURCES.md` for additional learning materials  

---

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:

- Source code (`.adb`, `.ads`)
- Notes (if applicable)
- References to learning materials

---

## Learning Progress

| Project Name | Description | Completion | Resources |
|--------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| [HelloWorld]() | Simple “Hello, Ada” program | 100% | *Page 4*: **Ada – A Crash Course** by Peter Chapin (Vermont Technical College, July 27, 2015) |
| [DirectHelloWorld]() | Demonstrates the `use` clause to make identifiers directly visible | 100% | *Page 4*: **Ada – A Crash Course** by Peter Chapin |
| [PrimeCheckingProgram]() | Accepts an integer from the user and determines whether it is a prime number | 50% | *Page 6*: **Ada – A Crash Course** by Peter Chapin |

## Personal Projects

This section will include original projects built independently as I deepen my understanding of Ada.

## Goals

- Master Ada syntax and structure  
- Understand packages and modular design  
- Learn tasking and concurrency  
- Explore SPARK for formal verification  
- Build small real-world console applications
